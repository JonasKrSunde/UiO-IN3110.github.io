"""
A Basic Monty Hall Game.
========================

Run with
python game_server4.py


Improvements to game_server3.py:

- Implement state as a module-wide dictionary game_state. When a new game is
started, we create a unique game_id and draw a random winning door and attach
it to the state. In the form in the select4.html template, we now pass the 
game_id as a URL parameter to /reselect. In the reselect function we can use
the request.get and request.form attributes to extract both the game_id and 
the user selected door. With that, we can implement the logic of the host to 
open a door (which is not the winning door). 

The result is rendered in the reselect in the reselect4.html page, where we
also added a form to pick another door. This form sends a POST request to
/final (again with the game_id attached)
